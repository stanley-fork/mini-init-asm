Description: tiny PID 1 init for containers (pure assembly)
 mini-init-asm is a tiny init intended for container entrypoints.
 It spawns exactly one main child in its own session and process group,
 forwards signals to the whole group, reaps children, and can optionally
 act as a simple restart-on-crash supervisor.
